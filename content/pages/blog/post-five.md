Respiratory diseases like **asthma, COPD, and viral infections** are rising globally, yet traditional monitoring methods are **slow, disconnected, and reactive**. 🌫️💨

🛑 **The Problem:**
🚨 **Delayed Diagnosis** – Patients often seek help **too late**, leading to complications.
📉 **Limited Real-Time Data** – PEF readings are **manually recorded**, making tracking unreliable.
📍 **No Geospatial Insights** – Respiratory disease **clusters go unnoticed** until outbreaks occur.
🌡️ **Environmental Factors Are Ignored** – Air pollution, humidity, and temperature **directly impact respiratory health** but are rarely factored into daily monitoring.

✅ **The Solution: ResSen**
ResSen transforms disposable **PEF meters into smart, connected tools**, allowing:
🔹 **Real-time respiratory data collection** via Bluetooth/NFC 📲
🔹 **AI-powered insights** for early disease detection 🤖
🔹 **Geospatial tracking** of respiratory health using Galileo & Copernicus satellites 🛰️
🔹 **Environmental risk assessments** for proactive health decisions 🌍

**💡 The Future of Respiratory Health is Here**
With ResSen, patients, doctors, and public health officials can make **data-driven decisions** to **prevent severe respiratory episodes** and **control outbreaks before they spread**.

🚀 **Join the revolution in respiratory health!** Let’s make breathing easier for everyone.
